# What is a Git branch?

A Git branch is like a separate timeline for your code. It allows you to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main code. Each branch has its own set of commits and changes.

The main branch (often called "main" or "master") is the primary version. You create new branches to experiment or develop features, then merge them back when ready.

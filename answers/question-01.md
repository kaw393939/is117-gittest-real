# What does git status do?

Git status shows you the current state of your Git repository. It tells you which branch you're on, which files have been modified, which files are staged for commit, and which files are untracked. This command is useful for checking what changes you've made before committing them.

Example output shows files in red (not staged) or green (staged and ready to commit).

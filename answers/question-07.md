# How do you use cd? Show 3 ways.

CD stands for "change directory". Here are three ways to use it:

1. **cd folder-name** - Moves into a folder in your current directory
2. **cd ..** - Moves up one level to the parent directory
3. **cd /full/path/to/folder** - Moves to an absolute path anywhere on the system

You can also use **cd ~** to go to your home directory or **cd -** to go back to the previous directory.

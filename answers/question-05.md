# What is git pull vs git push?

Git pull downloads changes from a remote repository (like GitHub) to your local computer. Git push uploads your local commits to the remote repository so others can see them.

Pull is used when you want to get the latest updates from teammates. Push is used when you want to share your work with others. Think of pull as "download" and push as "upload".

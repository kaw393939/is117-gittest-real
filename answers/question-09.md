# How do you create a directory?

You use the **mkdir** command (make directory) to create a new folder. 

Examples:
- **mkdir myfolder** - Creates a folder named "myfolder" in the current directory
- **mkdir -p path/to/nested/folder** - Creates nested folders, including parent directories if they don't exist

The -p flag is useful when you need to create multiple levels of directories at once.

# What is cp vs mv?

**CP** (copy) duplicates a file or directory. The original stays, and you get a copy. Example: cp file.txt backup.txt creates a copy named backup.txt

**MV** (move) relocates or renames a file. The original is gone. Example: mv file.txt newname.txt renames it, or mv file.txt /other/folder moves it.

CP preserves the original, MV does not. Use cp for backups, mv for organizing or renaming.

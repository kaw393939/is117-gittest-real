# What does ls -la show?

The ls -la command lists all files and directories in the current location with detailed information. The -l flag shows long format (permissions, owner, size, date), and the -a flag shows hidden files (those starting with a dot).

You'll see file permissions, number of links, owner, group, file size in bytes, modification date, and filename. Hidden files like .git and .gitignore are also displayed.
